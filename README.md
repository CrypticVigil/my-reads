## Project Description
A book tracking app that enables you to organize books you are reading, have read, or would like to read someday. You can also search for new books to add to your collection.

## Dependencies & Installation

This project is built using React. To get it set up and install all the dependencies, you will need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, you should navigate to the app directory and run this command:
```
npm install
```
After that's completed, you can launch the app by running:
```
npm start
```
A new browser window should open showing the app home page. If it doesn't, you can always go there directly at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

## Using the App

When you start the app, the main screen will show lists of books you are currently reading, want to read, or have read. You can move books between lists by clicking the button on the bottom right corner of the book.

To find new books, click the search button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then you can type what you're looking for into the search bar at the top.
